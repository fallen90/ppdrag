ppDrag is a Drag&Drop plugin for [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), which mimics the interface of [jQuery UI](http://ui.jquery.com/)'s [Draggable](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggables). Currently supported is a small subset of its options, but the implementation is different (ppDrag focuses on performance).

The speed difference is more visible with slower CPU's. Also, due to JavaScript engine optimizations in the last generation browsers, the speed difference is less than with older browsers. For example, the difference is greater with Firefox 2 than with Firefox 3.

All major existing browsers are supported. This includes IE6/7, Firefox1/2/3, Opera, Konqueror, Safari, and probably others.

Documentation and demo are available on the [official site](http://ppdrag.ppetrov.com/).
